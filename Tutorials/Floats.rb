# Integers can hold well beyond large numbers

# Ruby stores integers through floats, number before decimal

num_one = 1.000

num99 = 0.999

puts num_one.to_s + " - " + num99.to_s + " = " + (num_one - num99).to_s

# Trust 14 digits of accuracy as norm, float arithmetic can be a little bit off

# Every thing within Ruby is an object
